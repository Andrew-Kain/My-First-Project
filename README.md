# About

AK GYMS is an made up website for the purposes of Mile Stone Project One

## User Experience (UX)

### User Requirements

#### Website Owner Goals

- The website should attract new members and grab the attention of the user.
- Make the website easy to use, clearly show the goal with not too much information.
- Ensure all relevant links to existing external websites are accessible on all pages of the website.
- Also to make the website responsive on all devices.

#### Website Visitor Goals

- The site to be easy to navigate.
- The site to have clear instructions on where and when group classes take place.
- To be able to see images of the gym and existing members.
- To be able to see what the gym offers.

### Strategy Tradeoffs

#### Strategy Criteria
 - To decide what features the website should have for its users. I created a [table](#strategy-table) and listed 14 main criteria. Then following UX strategy, I came up with a solution on what were the most important and which could be traded off.
 - The strategy used was to give each of the criteria a score; the first being importance; how crucial is this for the user? The second being viability/feasibility, how realistic is it that we implement this for the user? 
 - The following table shows the results of this strategy.

#### Strategy Reasons

- The table below documents the reasons why each part of the criteria was used, or not, in the final website. The reason section shows how I judged each criteria to see if it was important and viable/feasible.

| Goal Criteria | Reference | Importance Score | Viability/Feasibility Score | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Create online presence | A | 5 | 5 | Easiest way to gather new members. |
| Own Website | B | 5 | 5 | Better consolidation of existing online resources |
| Show location/ map | C | 5 | 5 | Essential. |
| Show prices | D | 3 | 3 | Different prices for gym and meet up group (All explained on website link). |
| Show when/ date, time | E | 5 | 4 | Essential. |
| Show who are organisers | F | 4 | 4 | Good idea to show faces. |
| Links to existing sites | G | 4 | 5 | Essential. |
| Reviews | H | 3 | 3 | Good idea but will need to ask existing members in person. |
| Links to gym location website | I | 2 | 4 | Not needed, need to steer users towards the dedicated links. |
| Get in touch/ questions form | J | 4 | 4 | Good idea for collecting FAQs.  |
| Images of climbers | K | 4 | 4 | Good idea to show what it looks like. |
| Images of location | L | 4 | 4 | Good idea to show what it looks like. |
| Contact info | M | 3 | 2 | Not needed, form and links covers this |
| Provide info on climbing shops | N | 2 | 3 | Not suited for the main goal |

# Design

### Colour Scheme

For the main logo design [Logoai](https://www.logoai.com/) was used, this gave me an idea to keep the colour scheme simple. Using mainly greens and whites, as I knew that I wanted to add plenty of photos, which themselves could bring colour. 

- '#3a3a3a' Was the colour I used throughout.
- '#252525' I used for h1 & h2
- '#ffffff' For cover txt.
- '#3a3a3a' Was used for borders.
- '#cccccc' Was used for border of circle container. 

### Typography

The font used in this website was Oswald, with a back up of Lato:300. I used a single font as I felt this suited the desired aesthetic of a more relaxed and informal atmosphere. I wanted to avoid the use of a rigid font, so visitors to the site could sense the desired attitude of the social group it was advertising.

The Font was imported from google fonts [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/selection/embed). It is used via the import link at the head of the [stylesheet](assets/css/style.css), this links all the text across the pages of the website to the appropriate style.

### Imagery

All imagery was imported from google images. 


### Wireframes

[balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop views.

#### Home Page

![home page](<New Wireframe 1.png>)

#### Gallery Page

![gallery](<New Wireframe 2-1.png>)

#### Sign Up Page

![sign up](<New Wireframe 3.png>)


### Features

The website is comprised of 3 pages in total, a home page, a gallery page, a sign up page.

All the pages are responsive and have the website logo at the top which also serves as a link back to the home page. 

#### The Home Page

The Home Page shows a background image of the gym where the group meets, this is important to show as it instantly grabs the user's attention. The header shows the main logo and links to other pages.

#### The Gallery Page

The Gallery page shows a collage of all areas of the gym, this shows the user and potential group memeber exactly what to expect. The header shows the main logo (which links back to the home page) and links to other pages. 


#### The Get In Touch/Form Page

The Get in touch page shows an image of people using the gym equiptment. It also contains a simple input form that reacts when a user clicks or hovers over it. The header shows the main logo (which links back to the home page) and links to other pages. On mobile this menu becomes a dropdown. The footer contains links to the groups social pages both Facebook and MeetUp.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a Latto:300 back up for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Also adding alt values for pictures for the benefit of screen readers.

## Bugs


### Known Bugs and Resolved Issues

| No | Bug | How I fixed the bug |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The Hero image on the pages didn't look right on mobile view. | after using chrome dvelopers tools and researchng the problem. I am came across the position image could be centered and fixed, this fixed the design issue. |
| 2 | Changing the footer text colour was'nt working | I first tried to chage the colour by using the .footer nav this did'nt work. This was solved by adding an extra .footer nav a style in the css file. |
| 3 | The dropdown menu in the header on the gallery page in mobile view | Using chrome developers tools and [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/), I fixed a design issue by changing the background colour navbar drop  |
| 4 | Typo Issues | Alot of issues where solved simply by re checking my code for typos.  |
| 5 | Gallery Quotes | I was struggling to insert images and text to make them look like they were a part of each other. To solve this I found code on [W3 Media Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_media_objects.asp) to help resolve this issue  |
| 6 | Font awesome not showing icons | I was using the wrong CDN at the top of my page. I found this link in a github forum.
