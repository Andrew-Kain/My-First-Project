I used Chrome developer tools, whilst building the website to ensure everything was working correctly and pinpoint and troubleshoot any errors or bugs.

I also used google chrome developer tools through each page to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.

## Automated Testing

### W3C Validator

I used [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the HTML on all pages of the website.

I used [W3C Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate the CSS file.
